wget https://github.com/stechtmann/BL4300-5300/raw/master/data/Weekly_Assignment_data/Unk_therm.faa


make a blastable database for the protein sequence
makeblastdb -in Unk_therm.faa -dbtype prot -title Unk_therm


download the hsp.fasta
wget https://github.com/stechtmann/BL4300-5300/raw/master/data/Weekly_Assignment_data/HSP_prot.fasta


Query the blastable database with hsp.fasta

blastp -db Unk_therm.faa -query HSP_prot.fasta -out HSP_BLAST.txt -outfmt 7


Use winSCP to look at the HSP_BLAST.txt file to answer the questions

How many HSPs were found in the unknown organism?
There were 71 HSPs found in the unknown organism (there were 71 hits found in the 6 queries)

The E-value is a statistical measure to say what is the probability that I found this match by chance. If these numbers are very low then it means that there is a very low probability of us finding this by chance so itâ€™s most likely a true match. So the lower the score the better


Based on the E-Values there are 10 potential HSPs in the unknown organism. Here are the 10 HSPs that were found in the unknown organism based on the e-values:

There is no hard cut off to say this is what is a paralog so argue that you made the right choice, just give a logical argument use the twilight zone
e value first if its significant then look at bit score and %identity and if you have something that will fit within the twilight zone  or the safe zone


How many HSP have paralogs?


Provide a justification for the presence of paralogs.
